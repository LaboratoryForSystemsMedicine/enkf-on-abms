# data-assimilation

A repository for work on data assimilation in the context of digital twins.

There is currently one top directory, `kalman`, which corresponds to a research project in which we use the ensemble Kalman filter as a tool for model personalization and parameterization. See the README in the subdirectory for details.

At a later date, we will either add another top directory for further work or restructure the repo entirely.

**Warning**: When cloning this repository, be aware that I'm using git submodules for various parts, so you will have
to use `git clone --recursive` instead of plain old `git clone`.
